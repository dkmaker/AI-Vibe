### Cline in Action: Interactive Demo
This demo illustrates how to effectively use Cline for web development tasks, highlighting the Plan/Act modes and the power of custom rules.

#### Demo Overview
The following example demonstrates creating a simple HTML page with embedded JavaScript that displays a greeting message and includes a button to change the text. We'll show how the same general prompt can produce different results based on whether custom rules are applied.

#### Example 1: Basic Prompting (Without Rules)
**Planning Phase Prompt:**
```
I need to create a simple HTML page with a "Hello, Cline!" message and a button that changes 
the text to "Hello, World!" when clicked. The page should have basic styling. 
Can you help me plan this?
```

**Action Phase Prompt:**
```
Create a simple HTML page with a "Hello, Cline!" message and a button that changes the text 
to "Hello, World!" when clicked. Add some basic styling to make it look nice. 
Save it in the examples/03-cline directory.
```

Without specific rules, Cline would create the file directly in the examples/03-cline directory.

#### Example 2: Rule-Enhanced Prompting
**Same Prompts as Example 1, but with a .clinerules file:**

```markdown
---
description: Rules for web development demos in the 03-cline examples
globs: ["examples/03-cline/**/*.html", "examples/03-cline/**/*.js"]
tags: ["web-demo", "organization"]
---

# Web Demo Output Organization

When creating web-related files (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) for the examples/03-cline directory:

1. **ALWAYS** place these files in the `examples/03-cline/web/` subdirectory
2. **ALWAYS** use the following structure:
   - HTML files in the root of the web directory
   - CSS files in a `css` subdirectory
   - JavaScript files in a `js` subdirectory (unless embedded in HTML)
3. **ALWAYS** include appropriate comments and documentation in the code

This ensures consistent organization of web demo files and improves maintainability.
```

With this rule in place, the exact same prompts would result in Cline placing the files in the `examples/03-cline/web/` directory instead, demonstrating how rules can make general instructions more precise without requiring the user to be explicit in their prompts.

#### The Power of Rules
This example demonstrates how .clinerules can:
1. Make general prompts more precise
2. Enforce consistent project organization
3. Reduce the need for detailed instructions in every prompt
4. Ensure best practices are followed automatically

### MCP Servers and Extensibility
- Extending AI tools through custom services
  * Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers allow developers to extend the capabilities of AI tools by creating custom services that provide specialized functionalities or access to proprietary data.
  * MCP servers act as bridges between AI tools and external systems, APIs, or data sources, enabling AI to perform tasks beyond its built-in capabilities.
- Creating specialized capabilities for domain-specific development
  * MCP enables the development of AI tools tailored to specific industries or technical domains, offering highly relevant and accurate assistance for niche problems.
  * Examples include connecting to specialized databases, interacting with proprietary systems, or integrating with industry-specific tools and services.
- Future roadmap for AI development tools
  * The future involves more sophisticated MCP integrations, enabling AI tools to interact with a wider array of external systems, learn from real-time data, and adapt to evolving development needs.
  * As MCP adoption grows, we'll see the emergence of ecosystems of specialized servers that can be easily shared and deployed across development teams.

#### The Power of MCP: Extending AI Capabilities

MCP servers fundamentally transform what AI tools can do by allowing them to:

1. **Access External Systems**: Connect to APIs, databases, and services that would otherwise be inaccessible
2. **Perform Specialized Tasks**: Execute domain-specific operations that require external tools or proprietary algorithms
3. **Work with Real-Time Data**: Fetch and process current information from live systems
4. **Leverage Existing Infrastructure**: Integrate with an organization's existing tools and workflows

#### Example: Chuck Norris Jokes MCP Server

Let's examine a simple but illustrative example of an MCP server that provides Chuck Norris jokes:

```
examples/03-mcpserver/
├── build/              # Compiled JavaScript files
├── src/                # TypeScript source code
│   └── index.ts        # Main server implementation
├── .gitignore
├── example-usage.js    # Example of how to use the server
├── mcp-settings-example.json  # Configuration for connecting the server
├── package.json        # Dependencies and scripts
├── README.md           # Documentation
└── tsconfig.json       # TypeScript configuration
```

This server connects to the public Chuck Norris API (https://api.chucknorris.io/) and exposes several tools:

- `get_joke_categories`: Lists all available joke categories
- `get_random_joke`: Retrieves a random joke, optionally filtered by category
- `get_joke_by_id`: Gets a specific joke by its ID
- `search_jokes`: Searches for jokes containing specific text

#### How to Create Your Own MCP Server

Creating an MCP server involves these key steps:

1. **Set Up the Project**:
   ```bash
   mkdir my-mcp-server
   cd my-mcp-server
   npm init -y
   npm install @modelcontextprotocol/sdk axios
   ```

2. **Implement the Server**:
   - Create a main file (e.g., `index.js` or `index.ts`)
   - Import the MCP SDK
   - Define your tools and their input schemas
   - Implement handlers for each tool
   - Set up the server transport (typically stdio)

3. **Configure the MCP Settings**:
   - Create or update your MCP settings file (e.g., `cline_mcp_settings.json`)
   - Add your server configuration with the command to run it
   - Specify any auto-approve settings for tools

4. **Build and Test**:
   - Build your server (if using TypeScript)
   - Test it with example usage
   - Integrate it with your AI tools

#### Sample Prompt Using MCP

Once your MCP server is configured, you can use it with prompts like:

```
I need to find a Chuck Norris joke related to software development. Can you use the 
Chuck Norris Jokes MCP server to find a joke in the right category?
```

This prompt would trigger the AI to:
1. Recognize the need to use the Chuck Norris Jokes MCP server
2. Call the appropriate tool (`get_random_joke` with category "dev")
3. Return a development-related Chuck Norris joke

The power of this approach is that the same pattern works for any custom capability you implement, from fetching weather data to querying internal databases or controlling IoT devices.



### Task-master AI Systems: Beyond Code Generation
