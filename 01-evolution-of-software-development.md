# 1. Evolution of Software Development (30 minutes)

### Traditional Development Lifecycle
- Overview of waterfall, agile, and DevOps approaches
  * **Waterfall:** A linear, sequential design process where progress flows downwards like a waterfall. Each phase must be completed before the next begins.
  * **Agile:** An iterative and incremental approach, focusing on collaboration, flexibility, and rapid delivery of working software in short cycles (sprints).
  * **DevOps:** A set of practices that combines software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops) to shorten the systems development life cycle and provide continuous delivery with high software quality.
- Key challenges: time-to-market, technical debt, communication barriers
  * **Time-to-market:** Traditional methods often lead to long development cycles, delaying product release and responsiveness to market changes.
  * **Technical debt:** Shortcuts or suboptimal solutions taken for short-term gains can accumulate, making future development and maintenance more difficult and costly.
  * **Communication barriers:** Siloed teams (e.g., development, QA, operations) can lead to misunderstandings, delays, and rework due to lack of seamless information flow.
- The bottlenecks in conventional development practices
  * Manual processes, lack of automation, and rigid phase gates often create chokepoints that slow down the entire development pipeline, from coding to deployment.

### The Rise of AI-Assisted Development
- Transition from manual coding to assisted workflows
  * AI tools are shifting the paradigm from developers writing every line of code manually to leveraging AI for code generation, completion, and refactoring, augmenting human capabilities.
- New paradigms: natural language programming, vibe coding
  * **Natural Language Programming:** Developers can describe desired functionality in plain language, and AI translates it into executable code.
  * **Vibe Coding:** A more intuitive and less rigid approach where AI understands the "intent" or "vibe" of the developer's goal, even with incomplete or abstract instructions.
- Statistical impact: development velocity and team composition changes
  * AI assistance significantly accelerates development cycles, leading to faster feature delivery. This also shifts team roles, with more emphasis on prompt engineering, AI oversight, and architectural design rather than pure coding.
  * Claim: In less than 2 years, the entire development process—including architecture, development, refinement, bug fixing, and evolution—will be maintainable by a set of AI agents based on researched requirements.

### The New Developer Workflow
- From requirements to deployment with AI assistance
  * AI tools can assist at every stage: interpreting requirements, generating initial code, writing tests, identifying bugs, and even automating deployment scripts, streamlining the entire process.
- Prompt-driven development as a methodology
  * Developers primarily interact with AI through carefully crafted prompts, guiding the AI to generate specific code, solve problems, or perform tasks, making prompt engineering a critical skill.
- Measuring productivity: old metrics vs. new benchmarks
  * Traditional metrics like lines of code or commit frequency become less relevant. New benchmarks focus on end-to-end cycle time, feature delivery rate, code quality (as assessed by AI and humans), and overall business impact.
